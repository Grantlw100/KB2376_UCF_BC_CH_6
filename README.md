## Features
Local Storage: Local storage is used to save the most recent searches so the same search does not have to be made more than once.

Responsive Design: When the size of the page changes, the DOM reflects the change in size across all elements. The UI is designed to adapt to the time of day so the dashboard is constantly fun to use.
